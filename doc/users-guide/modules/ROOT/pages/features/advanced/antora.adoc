= Antora
:description: This plugin support Antora attributes like 'imagesdir' and 'examplesdir'. It also resolves xrefs and includes in the preview.

https://antora.org/[Antora] helps to write and publish documentation web sites.
It allows combining documentation from multiple repositories into a single website.

Each documentation component contains an `antora.yml` file https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/standard-directories/[with a common directory structure] with meta information about that component.

== Pre-Requisites

You need to upgrade to version 0.30.31 or later of the plugin.
Initial support has been added in issue https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-intellij-plugin/issues/373[#373].

Auto-complete in `antora.yml` files was implemented starting with plugin version 0.32.54.

== Detection of Antora

The plugin will activate Antora support once it finds a file `antora.yml` and a sub-folder `modules`.
Antora will be active for all AsciiDoc files located in folders below such a file.
Once the plugin detects Antora, it activates its Antora features.

== Support provided by the plugin

=== Antora references support

When using the Antora xref macro like `+xref:version@component:module:page.adoc[]+`, the plugin will resolve links to the specific version, component and module with in the current projects.
For this it searches all available `antora.yml` files in the current project.

For `include::[]` macros the plugin supports the Antora families like `partial$`, `example$` and `page$`.

=== Antora editor support

In the editor the user can autocomplete filenames and references using kbd:[Ctrl+Space] and can navigate to a folder or file using kbd:[Ctrl+B].

To allow auto-completion for components that reside in different Git repositories, consider using a xref:features/advanced/multimodule.adoc[multi-module project].

=== Antora YAML schema support

When editing an `antora.yml` or `antora-playbook.yml` file, the plugin provides JSON-Schema support for validation, auto-completion and documentation.
Press kbd:[Ctrl+Q] for quick help on each attribute.

For the keys _nav_ and _start_page_ in `antora.yml`, the plugin provides auto-completion.

=== Antora preview support

The preview renders images, includes and links.
It also resolves https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/page/reftext-and-navtitle/[reftext and navtitle in the preview^] (new in Antora 2.3).
The user can click on links in the preview that will then open in the editor if they link to a local Antora page.

Users can customize the styling of the preview by referencing a stylesheet.
See section _xref:features/advanced/stylesheets.adoc#remote-stylesheet[Using a remote stylesheet]_ for details.

=== Antora attributes support

The plugin reads all attributes defined in the module's `antora.yml` file's _asciidoc.attributes_ section and uses this for the preview and auto-completion.

The plugin sets multiple attributes to allow referencing files with the current Antora module:

imagesdir:: pointing to `images` of the current module (or `assets/images`, the Antora pre-2.1 style, if that folder exists)

partialsdir:: pointing to `partials` of the current module (or `pages/_partials`, the Antora pre-1.1 style, if that folder exists)

attachmentsdir:: pointing to `attachments` of the current module (or `assets/attachments`, the Antora pre-2.1 style, if that folder exists)

examplesdir:: pointing to `examples` of the current module

page-*:: These and several other intrinsic attributes are supported for the preview like `page-component-version`, `page-module` etc.

Any of these attributes is set only if the directory exists.
While `imagesdir` and `attachmentsdir` use a relative path so that they work best with image and link macros, `examplesdir` and `partialsdir` use an absolute path that works best with includes macros.

=== Examples of supported Antora syntax

// suppress inspection "AsciiDocLinkResolve" for whole file
// as links in example should not be validated
[source,asciidoc]
------
// images from the assets/images folder - no prefix necessary as imagesdir attribute is set
image::animage.png[some image]

// offer downloads
link:{attachmentsdir}/file.zip[Download]

// include content into a page
\include::partial$some-recurring-content.adoc[]
\include::{partialsdir}/some-recurring-content.adoc[]
\include::component:module:partial$some-recurring-content.adoc[]

// include snippets from examples
[source,java]
----
\include::example$test.java[tags=e1]
\include::{examplesdir}/test.java[tags=e1]
\include::component:module:example$test.java[tags=e1]
----

// reference documents in the same module
xref:mail-component.adoc[SMTP]

// reference documents in a different component and module
xref:component:module:mail-component.adoc[SMTP]
------
